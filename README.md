# Hello, World! 🌍

I’m Muhammad Amir khan 👋

Welcome to **scuv-del**, my personal repository where I explore and develop various technical projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on several exciting projects:
  - **Tiger and Dinosaur Population Model**: Using Insight Maker to analyze population dynamics and ecosystem equilibrium over time.
  - **Risk Assessment for Bank Checks**: A study focusing on banking errors such as mismatched signatures and invalid check numbers.
  - **Hybrid Sorting Algorithms**: Optimizing the combination of QuickSort and Insertion Sort for performance in large datasets.
  - **S-DES and RSA Cryptography Implementation**: Developing encryption and decryption functionalities with test cases and documented solutions.
  - **Wi-Fi Adapter Optimization**: Using C++ to combine multiple Wi-Fi connections for increased internet speed and efficiency.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Advanced cryptography techniques for modern cybersecurity.
  - Cross-platform development with Python, focusing on device management and USB control.
  - System dynamics and ecological modeling using tools like NetLogo.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - **Distributed Systems** (Hadoop, Spark, and more).
  - **Cryptography Projects** that focus on secure communication and encryption.

- 💬 Ask me about:
  - **Sorting Algorithms** and hybrid approaches for improving performance.
  - **USB device management** using Python and C++.
  - **System Dynamics Modeling** for population studies.
